    "We hypothesize that there will be a negative correlation between opioid-related incidents and both median housing prices and market velocity (average time spent on Zillow) in Portland between 2020 and 2021. Specifically, as opioid overdoses and hospitalizations increased in certain zip codes, we predict that home sale prices in those areas decreased relative to the city average, while the \"days on Zillow\" significantly increased."

    "The ideal dataset to answer this question is one that gives the number of opioid incidents-hospitalizations, overdoses, checks into rehab-in Portland before Measure 110's enactment, during Measure 110 being a law, and ideally, but unlikely due to the recency, after Measure 110's reversal. We want to be able to find data on this so we can start to establish a potential correlation to housing prices as well as average time spent on zillow. We will want a secondary dataset regarding this information on housing prices and time spent on zillow. This data is collected from various kaggle datasets, informative papers on opioid usage amid Measure 110's legalization, and other revelant finance/housing datasets. This gives us a lot of observations for our data, and we don't want to outright limit ourselves, but something we can do during this is merge the total number of drug incidents in a month with housing price change and time spent on zillow from month to month. From this, we can explore the data to see if we find trends between when Measure 110 was active versus not active, if there were changes in the leadup to it's enactment, and/or if it worsens as time went, therefore meaning we could infer trends about Measure 110's impact as time went on.\n",
    "We want to store the data we have in tables of our own through proper cleaning and wrangling, and then create displays to model the correlations we observe. We also are open to accounting for outside factors, which we may reference in our conclusion after giving background on the events surrounding Measure 110.\n",

Given our background, several papers can be used to assist in discussing drug use specifically in Portland."

    " - [X] **A.1 Informed consent**: If there are human subjects, have they given informed consent, where subjects affirmatively opt-in and have a clear understanding of the data uses to which they consent?\n",
    "\n",
    "> Example of how to use the checkbox, and also of how you can put in a short paragraph that discusses the way this checklist item affects your project.  Remove this paragraph and the X in the checkbox before you fill this out for your project\n",
    "\n",
    " - [X] **A.2 Collection bias**: Have we considered sources of bias that could be introduced during data collection and survey design and taken steps to mitigate those?\n",
    ">Drug incidence data is often a proxy for policing intensity rather than actual drug usage rates. Low-income neighborhoods or areas with more public transit may show higher drug incidence in police records because of increased surveillance, not necessarily because drug use is higher than high-income areas.\n",
    " - [X] **A.3 Limit PII exposure**: Have we considered ways to minimize exposure of personally identifiable information (PII) for example through anonymization or not collecting information that isn't relevant for analysis?\n",
    ">We should ensure that you are using aggregated data rather than individual data.\n",
    " - [X] **A.4 Downstream bias mitigation**: Have we considered ways to enable testing downstream results for biased outcomes (e.g., collecting data on protected group status like race or gender)?\n",
    ">Our project involves \"protected group status\" implicitly through geographic proxies (zip codes). There is a risk that findings could be used to further stigmatize specific Portland neighborhoods or justify \"redlining-like\" behavior in real estate. We should attempt to discuss the socioeconomic confounding variables (like poverty rates or historical disinvestment) that impact both housing prices and public health outcomes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### B. Data Storage\n",
    " - [X] **B.1 Data security**: Do we have a plan to protect and secure data (e.g., encryption at rest and in transit, access controls on internal users and third parties, access logs, and up-to-date software)?\n",
    ">While the datasets are public, we will maintain a secure workflow to ensure data security. All data will be processed and stored in a private Github repository. Only team members and course staff will have access.\n",
    " - [X] **B.2 Right to be forgotten**: Do we have a mechanism through which an individual can request their personal information be removed?\n",
    " - [X] **B.3 Data retention plan**: Is there a schedule or plan to delete the data after it is no longer needed?\n",
    ">Our team will retain the data only for the duration of the Winter 2026 quarter. Once we have received our final grade, we will delete all local copies of the dataset and archive the Github repository.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### C. Analysis\n",
    " - [X] **C.1 Missing perspectives**: Have we sought to address blindspots in the analysis through engagement with relevant stakeholders (e.g., checking assumptions and discussing implications with affected communities and subject matter experts)?\n",
    " - [X] **C.2 Dataset bias**: Have we examined the data for possible sources of bias and taken steps to mitigate or address these biases (e.g., stereotype perpetuation, confirmation bias, imbalanced classes, or omitted confounding variables)?\n",
    " - [X] **C.3 Honest representation**: Are our visualizations, summary statistics, and reports designed to honestly represent the underlying data?\n",
    " - [X] **C.4 Privacy in analysis**: Have we ensured that data with PII are not used or displayed unless necessary for the analysis?\n",
    " - [X] **C.5 Auditability**: Is the process of generating the analysis well documented and reproducible if we discover issues in the future?\n",
    "\n",
    "### D. Modeling\n",
    " - [X] **D.1 Proxy discrimination**: Have we ensured that the model does not rely on variables or proxies for variables that are unfairly discriminatory?\n",
    " - [X] **D.2 Fairness across groups**: Have we tested model results for fairness with respect to different affected groups (e.g., tested for disparate error rates)?\n",
    ">We are aware of potential confounds related to race, financial background, and mental illness. All of these are well documented elements in Measure 110's history, and we believe that the model results will be generalized to be fair with respect to different groups, since we will not be concentrating on any of these aspects in our models. Groups could be revisited in our conclusion if a weak correlation is drawn.\n",
    " - [X] **D.3 Metric selection**: Have we considered the effects of optimizing for our defined metrics and considered additional metrics?\n",
    ">Additional metrics plan to be substantiated by the background given, and we have also uncovered papers which have good data models that we want to replicate. By replicating these models, we can wrangle the data to work with other datasets of ours, and begin to explore and analyze data further. Optimizing our defined metrics directly is related to consulting outside sources, and we are prepared to cite these sources appropriately.\n",
    " - [X] **D.4 Explainability**: Can we explain in understandable terms a decision the model made in cases where a justification is needed?\n",
    " - [X] **D.5 Communicate limitations**: Have we communicated the shortcomings, limitations, and biases of the model to relevant stakeholders in ways that can be generally understood?\n",
    "\n",
    "### E. Deployment\n",
    " - [X] **E.1 Monitoring and evaluation**: Do we have a clear plan to monitor the model and its impacts after it is deployed (e.g., performance monitoring, regular audit of sample predictions, human review of high-stakes decisions, reviewing downstream impacts of errors or low-confidence decisions, testing for concept drift)?\n",
    " - [X] **E.2 Redress**: Have we discussed with our organization a plan for response if users are harmed by the results (e.g., how does the data science team evaluate these cases and update analysis and models to prevent future harm)?\n",
    ">Similar to D.2, if we find that our model accentuates more complex relationships in race for instance, we would want a disclaimer of what our data looks at and the connection it aims to establish, and what the data does not suggest. We want to ensure our data is communicated in a way that is indicative of what we wanted to establish a correlational between, and do not want our data used in samples that to make correlations that it was not intended for. If users are excessively harmed, we will act accordingly to have our data be more selective to public. This also doubles as an answer for E.4.\n",
    " - [X] **E.3 Roll back**: Is there a way to turn off or roll back the model in production if necessary?\n",
    " - [X] **E.4 Unintended use**: Have we taken steps to identify and prevent unintended uses and abuse of the model and do we have a plan to monitor these once the model is deployed?\n"
