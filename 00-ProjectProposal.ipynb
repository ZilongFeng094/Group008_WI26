    "Our topic is on housing prices & drug usage in Portland, specifically before and after the 2020 Oregon Ballot Measure 110 was passed. Measure 110 reduced the penalties for drug possession for small amounts of controlled substances, reducing it from a class A misdemeanor to class E. We want to study how this may have affected the general population of Portland's access to housing, and if drug usage was related during this time period. \n",
    "\n",
    "A number of studies were conducted about this time period, all which studied the effect of drug decriminalization in Portland in specific categories. \n",
    "\n",
    "One study found that housing instability and opioid related harms often rise together, especially in areas facing rapid policy shifts. Using cross-sectional survey data from unstably housed individuals with a history of drug use, the study identified key demographic and behavioral factors associated with access to housing assistance, including frequency of opioid use and community supervision status. The study stated that, \"Participants were recruited [...] with partner agencies that provide supportive services [...] direct outreach by the study team to homeless\"<a name=\"cite_ref-1\"></a>[<sup>2</sup>](#cite_note-1). While this research focuses on individuals already experiencing housing instability, our study differs by examining broader population-level trends in Portland before and after the passage of Measure 110. Rather than relying on survey data, we analyze changes in housing prices alongside drug usage indicators to explore whether decriminalization coincided with shifts in housing accessibility and market conditions. This allows us to investigate potential associations at a city-wide level and assess how policy changes may have impacted both housing dynamics and drug use simultaneously over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another study examined whether Oregon’s 2021 decriminalization of drug possession was linked to changes in overdose mortality while accounting for the spread of fentanyl in the unregulated drug market. The study found that “decriminalization of drug possession was not associated with an increase in fatal drug overdose rates in Oregon in the 2 years after its enactment” once fentanyl was considered as a confounding factor<a name=\"cite_ref-2\"></a>[<sup>2</sup>](#cite_note-2). The authors emphasized that fentanyl is “the principal driver of the overdose mortality epidemic in the US,” suggesting that increases in overdose deaths cannot be attributed to Measure 110 alone. While this research focuses on overdose mortality rather than housing outcomes, it is still relevant to our study because it highlights the importance of accounting for external factors when evaluating the effects of drug policy changes. Our research builds on this idea by examining housing prices and drug usage trends in Portland before and after Measure 110 to better understand how policy changes may have impacted the broader community.\n",

    "The ideal dataset to answer this question is one that gives the number of opioid incidents-hospitalizations, overdoses, checks into rehab-in Portland before Measure 110's enactment, during Measure 110 being a law, and ideally, but unlikely due to the recency, after Measure 110's reversal. We want to be able to find data on this so we can start to establish a potential correlation to housing prices as well as average time spent on zillow. We will want a secondary dataset regarding this information on housing prices and time spent on zillow. This data is collected from various kaggle datasets, informative papers on opioid usage amid Measure 110's legalization, and other revelant finance/housing datasets. This gives us a lot of observations for our data, and we don't want to outright limit ourselves, but something we can do during this is merge the total number of drug incidents in a month with housing price change and time spent on zillow from month to month. From this, we can explore the data to see if we find trends between when Measure 110 was active versus not active, if there were changes in the leadup to it's enactment, and/or if it worsens as time went, therefore meaning we could infer trends about Measure 110's impact as time went on.\n",
    "We want to store the data we have in tables of our own through proper cleaning and wrangling, and then create displays to model the correlations we observe. We also are open to accounting for outside factors, which we may reference in our conclusion after giving background on the events surrounding Measure 110.\n",

    " - [X] **A.2 Collection bias**: Have we considered sources of bias that could be introduced during data collection and survey design and taken steps to mitigate those?\n",
    ">Drug incidence data is often a proxy for policing intensity rather than actual drug usage rates. Low-income neighborhoods or areas with more public transit may show higher drug incidence in police records because of increased surveillance, not necessarily because drug use is higher than high-income areas.\n",
    " - [X] **A.3 Limit PII exposure**: Have we considered ways to minimize exposure of personally identifiable information (PII) for example through anonymization or not collecting information that isn't relevant for analysis?\n",
    ">We should ensure that you are using aggregated data rather than individual data.\n",
    " - [X] **A.4 Downstream bias mitigation**: Have we considered ways to enable testing downstream results for biased outcomes (e.g., collecting data on protected group status like race or gender)?\n",
    ">Our project involves \"protected group status\" implicitly through geographic proxies (zip codes). There is a risk that findings could be used to further stigmatize specific Portland neighborhoods or justify \"redlining-like\" behavior in real estate.

    ">We are aware of potential confounds related to race, financial background, and mental illness. All of these are well documented elements in Measure 110's history, and we believe that the model results will be generalized to be fair with respect to different groups, since we will not be concentrating on any of these aspects in our models. Groups could be revisited in our conclusion if a weak correlation is drawn.\n",
    " - [X] **D.3 Metric selection**: Have we considered the effects of optimizing for our defined metrics and considered additional metrics?\n",
    ">Additional metrics plan to be substantiated by the background given, and we have also uncovered papers which have good data models that we want to replicate. By replicating these models, we can wrangle the data to work with other datasets of ours, and begin to explore and analyze data further. Optimizing our defined metrics directly is related to consulting outside sources, and we are prepared to cite these sources appropriately.\n",
    " - [X] **D.4 Explainability**: Can we explain in understandable terms a decision the model made in cases where a justification is needed?\n",
    " - [X] **D.5 Communicate limitations**: Have we communicated the shortcomings, limitations, and biases of the model to relevant stakeholders in ways that can be generally understood?\n",
    "\n",
    "### E. Deployment\n",
    " - [X] **E.1 Monitoring and evaluation**: Do we have a clear plan to monitor the model and its impacts after it is deployed (e.g., performance monitoring, regular audit of sample predictions, human review of high-stakes decisions, reviewing downstream impacts of errors or low-confidence decisions, testing for concept drift)?\n",
    " - [X] **E.2 Redress**: Have we discussed with our organization a plan for response if users are harmed by the results (e.g., how does the data science team evaluate these cases and update analysis and models to prevent future harm)?\n",
    ">Similar to D.2, if we find that our model accentuates more complex relationships in race for instance, we would want a disclaimer of what our data looks at and the connection it aims to establish, and what the data does not suggest. We want to ensure our data is communicated in a way that is indicative of what we wanted to establish a correlational between, and do not want our data used in samples that to make correlations that it was not intended for. If users are excessively harmed, we will act accordingly to have our data be more selective to public. This also doubles as an answer for E.4.\n",
    " - [X] **E.3 Roll back**: Is there a way to turn off or roll back the model in production if necessary?\n",
    " - [X] **E.4 Unintended use**: Have we taken steps to identify and prevent unintended uses and abuse of the model and do we have a plan to monitor these once the model is deployed?\n"
