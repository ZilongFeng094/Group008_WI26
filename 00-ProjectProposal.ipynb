    "Our topic is on housing prices & drug usage in Portland, specifically before and after the 2020 Oregon Ballot Measure 110 was passed. Measure 110 reduced the penalties for drug possession for small amounts of controlled substances, reducing it from a class A misdemeanor to class E. We want to study how this may have affected the general population of Portland's access to housing, and if drug usage was related during this time period. \n",

    "A number of studies were conducted about this time period, all which studied the effect of drug decriminalization in Portland in specific categories. \n",
    "\n",
    "One study found that housing instability and opioid related harms often rise together, especially in areas facing rapid policy shifts. Using cross-sectional survey data from unstably housed individuals with a history of drug use, the study identified key demographic and behavioral factors associated with access to housing assistance, including frequency of opioid use and community supervision status. The study stated that, \"Participants were recruited [...] with partner agencies that provide supportive services [...] direct outreach by the study team to homeless\"<a name=\"cite_ref-1\"></a>[<sup>2</sup>](#cite_note-1). While this research focuses on individuals already experiencing housing instability, our study differs by examining broader population-level trends in Portland before and after the passage of Measure 110. Rather than relying on survey data, we analyze changes in housing prices alongside drug usage indicators to explore whether decriminalization coincided with shifts in housing accessibility and market conditions. This allows us to investigate potential associations at a city-wide level and assess how policy changes may have impacted both housing dynamics and drug use simultaneously over time.\n",

    "Another study examined whether Oregon’s 2021 decriminalization of drug possession was linked to changes in overdose mortality while accounting for the spread of fentanyl in the unregulated drug market. The study found that “decriminalization of drug possession was not associated with an increase in fatal drug overdose rates in Oregon in the 2 years after its enactment” once fentanyl was considered as a confounding factor<a name=\"cite_ref-2\"></a>[<sup>2</sup>](#cite_note-2). The authors emphasized that fentanyl is “the principal driver of the overdose mortality epidemic in the US,” suggesting that increases in overdose deaths cannot be attributed to Measure 110 alone. While this research focuses on overdose mortality rather than housing outcomes, it is still relevant to our study because it highlights the importance of accounting for external factors when evaluating the effects of drug policy changes. Our research builds on this idea by examining housing prices and drug usage trends in Portland before and after Measure 110 to better understand how policy changes may have impacted the broader community.\n",
